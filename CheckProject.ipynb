According to data on open-source repositories, the median commit count per month for actively maintained repositories is around 50 commits. Blockchain projects that surpass this are considered highly active.\n",

    "Moderate (5-10 contributors): This range represents moderately collaborative projects, still maintaining sufficient contributor engagement.\n",

    "Issue and Pull Request Management Thresholds:\n",

    "High Responsiveness (80%+ resolved in 30 days): A study on OSS repositories shows that well-maintained projects resolve the majority of issues quickly, with 80% or more closed within a month.\n",
    "Moderate Responsiveness (50-80% resolved): Represents adequate maintenance; still actively managed but not as promptly.\n",
    "Low Responsiveness (< 50% resolved): Slow resolution rates often signify stalled or struggling projects.\n",
    "Forks and Stars:\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing, stable, and declining trends are based on changes observed over a 6-month period, with active projects generally showing a steady increase in forks and stars as proxies for interest and adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Social Media (X/Twitter) Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Engagement Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 1000 engagements/month): Top-performing blockchain projects tend to have high visibility, with notable engagement rates. For active blockchain projects, 1000 engagements per month (including likes, retweets, replies) represents a strong level of community interaction.\n",
    "Moderate (500-1000 engagements/month): Reflects decent engagement and a still-active community.\n",
    "Low (< 500 engagements/month): Often indicates limited reach or waning interest, common for smaller or less visible projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive (> 0.3 average score): Sentiment analysis tools classify above 0.3 as generally positive, which is typical for thriving communities.\n",
    "Neutral (-0.3 to 0.3): Mixed or balanced sentiment is indicative of a stable but not overly enthusiastic community.\n",
    "Negative (< -0.3): Projects facing issues often attract negative sentiment, which can be a sign of underlying problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follower Growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Growth (> 5%/month): Reflects growing popularity and increasing community size, aligned with successful projects.\n",
    "Moderate Growth (1-5%/month): Indicates steady growth, sufficient to suggest ongoing interest.\n",
    "Low Growth (< 1%/month): Stagnant or declining follower counts can indicate declining project momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mainnet Transactions and On-Chain Activity Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainnet Transaction Volume: \n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 10,000 transactions/month): For blockchain projects with active usage, this figure represents the average seen in mid-tier blockchain networks. Larger projects often exceed this by a significant margin.\n",
    "Moderate (5,000-10,000 transactions/month): This range captures moderate usage levels, typical for projects with a specific niche or less frequent interactions.\n",
    "Low (< 5,000 transactions/month): Projects with fewer than 5,000 transactions per month are generally underused, often seen in struggling or less-adopted networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 2,000 addresses/month): Represents a healthy user base engaging with the blockchain, as seen in moderately successful blockchain ecosystems.\n",
    "Moderate (1,000-2,000 addresses/month): Indicates moderate engagement, sufficient to maintain activity but not indicative of high growth.\n",
    "Low (< 1,000 addresses/month): Common in smaller or declining networks, signaling reduced user interaction.\n",
    "Token Circulation and Transfers:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 20,000 transfers/month): High token movement suggests active trading or usage within the ecosystem.\n",
    "Moderate (10,000-20,000 transfers/month): Indicates ongoing but not extensive token usage.\n",
    "Low (< 10,000 transfers/month): Often reflects a lack of user engagement or low network activity.\n"
