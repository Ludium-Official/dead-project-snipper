    "- Social media engagement metrics are based on **typical ranges observed in crypto community analytics and social media benchmarking reports**.\n",
    "- Mainnet transaction volumes and active address counts were informed by blockchain analytics from mid-tier to popular blockchain projects, as observed in platforms like Etherscan, Dune Analytics, and other blockchain explorer data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Github Metrics: \n",
    "Commit Frequency Thresholds:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 50 commits/month): Projects with consistent, high commit rates are typically under active development. According to data on open-source repositories, the median commit count per month for actively maintained repositories is around 50 commits. Blockchain projects that surpass this are considered highly active.\n",
    "Moderate (20-50 commits/month): This range captures projects that are steadily maintained but might not be under intense development. The 20-50 range represents the interquartile range for many active blockchain projects.\n",
    "Low (< 20 commits/month): Projects with fewer than 20 commits per month are often in maintenance mode or seeing reduced activity. This threshold aligns with the lower quartile of commit activity seen across many GitHub repositories.\n",
    "Contributor Count Thresholds:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 10 contributors): Active blockchain projects often involve multiple developers. Data from open-source software (OSS) projects indicates that successful and actively maintained projects usually have at least 10 contributors.\n",
    "Moderate (5-10 contributors): This range represents moderately collaborative projects, still maintaining sufficient contributor engagement.\n",
    "Low (< 5 contributors): Projects with fewer than 5 active contributors often indicate limited engagement, which is common in smaller or declining projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue and Pull Request Management Thresholds:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Responsiveness (80%+ resolved in 30 days): A study on OSS repositories shows that well-maintained projects resolve the majority of issues quickly, with 80% or more closed within a month.\n",
    "Moderate Responsiveness (50-80% resolved): Represents adequate maintenance; still actively managed but not as promptly.\n",
    "Low Responsiveness (< 50% resolved): Slow resolution rates often signify stalled or struggling projects.\n",
    "Forks and Stars:\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing, stable, and declining trends are based on changes observed over a 6-month period, with active projects generally showing a steady increase in forks and stars as proxies for interest and adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Social Media (X/Twitter) Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Engagement Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 1000 engagements/month): Top-performing blockchain projects tend to have high visibility, with notable engagement rates. For active blockchain projects, 1000 engagements per month (including likes, retweets, replies) represents a strong level of community interaction.\n",
    "Moderate (500-1000 engagements/month): Reflects decent engagement and a still-active community.\n",
    "Low (< 500 engagements/month): Often indicates limited reach or waning interest, common for smaller or less visible projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive (> 0.3 average score): Sentiment analysis tools classify above 0.3 as generally positive, which is typical for thriving communities.\n",
    "Neutral (-0.3 to 0.3): Mixed or balanced sentiment is indicative of a stable but not overly enthusiastic community.\n",
    "Negative (< -0.3): Projects facing issues often attract negative sentiment, which can be a sign of underlying problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follower Growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Growth (> 5%/month): Reflects growing popularity and increasing community size, aligned with successful projects.\n",
    "Moderate Growth (1-5%/month): Indicates steady growth, sufficient to suggest ongoing interest.\n",
    "Low Growth (< 1%/month): Stagnant or declining follower counts can indicate declining project momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mainnet Transactions and On-Chain Activity Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainnet Transaction Volume: \n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 10,000 transactions/month): For blockchain projects with active usage, this figure represents the average seen in mid-tier blockchain networks. Larger projects often exceed this by a significant margin.\n",
    "Moderate (5,000-10,000 transactions/month): This range captures moderate usage levels, typical for projects with a specific niche or less frequent interactions.\n",
    "Low (< 5,000 transactions/month): Projects with fewer than 5,000 transactions per month are generally underused, often seen in struggling or less-adopted networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 2,000 addresses/month): Represents a healthy user base engaging with the blockchain, as seen in moderately successful blockchain ecosystems.\n",
    "Moderate (1,000-2,000 addresses/month): Indicates moderate engagement, sufficient to maintain activity but not indicative of high growth.\n",
    "Low (< 1,000 addresses/month): Common in smaller or declining networks, signaling reduced user interaction.\n",
    "Token Circulation and Transfers:\n",
    "\n",
    "High (> 20,000 transfers/month): High token movement suggests active trading or usage within the ecosystem.\n",
    "Moderate (10,000-20,000 transfers/month): Indicates ongoing but not extensive token usage.\n",
    "Low (< 10,000 transfers/month): Often reflects a lack of user engagement or low network activity.\n"
