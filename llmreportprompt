'''
You will evaluate projects funded by Gitcoin grants based on their activity on Twitter (X) and GitHub.
You should use specific scoring criteria to determine if the projects are still ongoing (alive) or not (dead).
You will analyze the provided data, calculate scores according to the criteria, and generate a report for each project.
I'm going to tell you the criteria soon.
Say "yes" if you understood what you should do.

And here is the example of the report that you have to make in the end.

[report example]
Project Evaluation Report
Project Name: OpenSourceWidget
Evaluation: Alive
Reason:
Based on the data, I would evaluate OpenSourceWidget as Alive.

Because the project has shown significant activity on both Twitter and GitHub, it has a high level of engagement with 45 posts, an average of 15 retweets and 35 likes per post, and a follower count of 6,200. Additionally, the GitHub activity is strong with 18 commits, 7 issues, and 5 pull requests, along with an increase of 30 watchers. This indicates that the project is still ongoing and actively maintained.
